# K2 Cartographer Setup

## Firmware

The Cartographer **MUST** be flashed with the special K1 firmware.

The instructions and script for doing so can be found [here](./firmware/README.md)

## Print Mount and spacers for K2

The mount and spacers required for the cartographer installation have been provided by stranula, [here](https://www.printables.com/model/1198696-k2-plus-cartographer-mount-shroud-and-spacers). We recommend printing these at a minimum in PETG, but ABS, ASA or any other high glass transition temp filament is preferred.

The files are provided in the desired printing orientation, use a setting that you are comfortable with for functional parts with reasonable tolerances

## Calibration

This is much the same as the process detailed [here](https://docs.cartographer3d.com/cartographer-probe/installation-and-setup/installation/calibration#initial-calibration), with only slight adjustments for the oddities of the K2.

***Note during this process you will sometimes experience homing anomolies, clunking sound by the bed (quick realeasing of z motors), or firmware crashes. While this seems concerning in the moment, it is "normal" and the clunking and random firmware crashes are stabalized after the calibration is completed. When you experience these anamolies, just start from the command again prior to crash. If necessary it is ok to reboot your machine. 

Issue the following commands in your Fluidd console:

```raw
PROBE_SWITCH MODE=touch
SAVE_CONFIG
```

Once Klipper restarts, enter the following command.

```raw
G28 X Y
```

The following `G28 Z` will lower the bed to the bottom of the printer, raise it and then give an error **No model loaded**, but it will also get the toolhead and bed near where we need them.

```raw
G28 Z
```

At this point you can query your endstops:

```raw
QUERY_ENDSTOPS
```

You will likely see something like the following:

```raw
x:open y:open z:TRIGGERED
```

This is normal and expected.

The following is needed on the K2 to allow us to walk the bed to the toolhead.

```raw
SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION Z=200
```

Now we begin the probe calibration process:

```raw
CARTOGRAPHER_CALIBRATE METHOD=manual
```

Use the Fluidd UI to raise the bed step by step toward the nozzle.  Use a piece of paper  or a feeler gauge to measure the offset. Once finished remove the paper/gauge and accept the position.

```raw
ACCEPT
```

```raw
SAVE_CONFIG
```

Wait for Klipper to restart.  Then, home the printer.

```raw
G28
```

Test the accuracy.  This will only use the scanning coil, it will not touch the bed.

```raw
PROBE_ACCURACY
```

Now to further tune the Cartographer we need to measure the backlash of the Z kinematics:

```raw
CARTOGRAPHER_ESTIMATE_BACKLASH
```

In output you're looking for the "delta" value. For example, the following shows my backlash as `0.00070`.

```raw
Median distance moving up 1.99701, down 1.99772, delta 0.00070 over 20 samples
```

Take your value, open the `custom/cartographer.cfg` and add the value inside the `[scanner]` section like so:

```raw
[scanner]
backlash_comp: 0.00070
```

## Touch

Home and level everything.

```raw
G28
Z_TILT_ADJUST
G28 Z
```

Initiate a threshold scan. This will determine your threshold for cartographer. The threshold will determine how much force is required to touch your bed consistently.

**This _will_ touch the nozzle to the bed**

Its okay if at first it doesnt touch the bed at all, this is completely normal. It will eventually start touching.

```raw
CARTOGRAPHER_THRESHOLD_SCAN
```

This _will_ take some time as several different thresholds are tested.  On the K2, we've found that around 1500 seems to be the magic point. If your machine settles on something other that 1500 you can try to run the command CARTOGROPHER_THRESHOLD_SCAN MIN=1500 and it will start from 1500 and run for a bit and should settle on 1500.

Now do a touch calibration with the new threshold.

```raw
CARTOGRAPHER_CALIBRATE
```

If everything went correctly the touch test should pass and you can now finish by saving these variables to your config.

```raw
SAVE_CONFIG
```
We recommend a full poweroff reboot because a lot of changes were made to you K2. This will ensure operational stability.
